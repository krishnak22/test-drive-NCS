#  AWS Login Guide  

Welcome! Before we begin, let's configure your AWS environment to ensure seamless access to your AWS account.  

##  Setting Up AWS Credentials  

To authenticate your AWS session, you need to provide your **AWS environment variables**. These credentials will allow you to interact with AWS services securely.  

### Steps to Configure AWS Access 

**Paste the credentials in your terminal**  
   
Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:  


   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token"
